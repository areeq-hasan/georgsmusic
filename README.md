Using the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, we oracularize characters into Qiskit circuits to generate pulse schedules and interfere their respective waveforms to create a unique sound for each word, effectively allowing us to hear quantum word encodings! We concatenate these word-wise waveforms to create a quantum musical representation of a sentence.

Type in your own sentence in our custom application, and experience your own quantum ‘song’!
